"Code review is a critical practice in software development. It is the process of examining code changes made by a developer before they are merged into the main codebase.

## 1\\. Keep Reviews Small

Smaller pull requests are easier to review and lead to more thorough feedback. Aim for PRs under 400 lines of changed code.

## 2\\. Review Code, Not People

Focus your feedback on the code, not the author. Use objective language and suggest improvements constructively.

## 3\\. Use Checklists

Create a standard checklist for reviews:

-   Does the code follow our style guide?
-   Are there adequate tests?
-   Is error handling appropriate?
-   Are there security concerns?

## 4\\. Automate What You Can

Use linters, formatters, and CI checks to catch style and syntax issues automatically.

## 5\\. Provide Context

As a reviewer, explain *why* you suggest changes, not just what to change."

TypeScript generics are a powerful feature that allows you to create reusable components that work with multiple types. They provide type safety without sacrificing flexibility.

## What Are Generics?

Generics enable you to write functions and classes that can work with any type while still maintaining full type information. Think of them as type variables that act as placeholders for actual types.

## Basic Syntax

Here's a simple example of a generic function:

\`\`\`
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}

const result = identity<string>("hello");
const num = identity(42); // type inferred
\`\`\`

## Generic Constraints

Sometimes you need to constrain generics to types that have certain properties:

\`\`\`
interface HasLength {
  length: number;
}

function logLength<T extends HasLength>(arg: T): void {
  console.log(arg.length);
}
\`\`\`

## Conclusion

Generics are essential for writing type-safe, reusable TypeScript code. Start with simple use cases and gradually adopt more complex patterns as needed."
